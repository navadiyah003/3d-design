I have used react js because
React JS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that provide a number of advantages over traditional HTML/CSS/JS development. 
Here are some key benefits that we experienced while working on our project:
* Improved performance: React uses a virtual DOM, which allows it to update only the parts of the DOM that need to be changed, resulting in faster rendering times and better overall performance. This is particularly important for our project which involves 3D object rendering on a browser.
* Reusable components: React allows developers to create reusable components, which can be used across multiple pages and applications, saving development time and effort. This means that we were able to create a modular and scalable codebase that is easier to maintain and extend.
